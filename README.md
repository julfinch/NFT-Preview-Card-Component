## My process

1. Created a div to put all details in the nft card .
2. After everything is already in place, I focused next on putting the overlay image of icon-view above the nft art image.
3. Then put the card at the middle of the page.
4. After that, I created two divs to become my primary and secondary shadow at the back of the card to crete depth.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge gave me my first implementation of overlaying an image over another and applying opacity to it. I've learned a lot about it.

I also was able to play a lot on how to put the shadow effect at the back of the card by creating two divs named as primary-shadow and secondary-shadow.

### Useful resources

- [Image Overlay](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_image_overlay_opacity) - This link helped me to play on the concept of overlaying the icon-view above the image-equilibrium.
